# Dsa - Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity : The amount of time the code take to execute and give output and it depends on the input size.

The Main Goal is to write a efficient code.

- we denote it by Big O notation

There are different notations

Big O - for worst case scenario, providing an upper bond of algorithm
Omega (Ω) - for best case scenario, providing an lower bond of algorithm
Theta (θ) Represents the average complexity of an algorithm of algorithm.

## How to Analyse Complexity of Algorithms

To analyse complexity of algorithm is to find number of operations involved in the algorithm

- Constant Time Complexity O(1):

The time complexity of a algorithm is consider as O(1) if it doesn’t contain a loop, recursion, and call to any other non-constant time function.

O(1) refers to constant time complexity.

```javascript
function some(num) {
  return (num * 5 - 4) / 3; // only one operation
}
```

- Linear Time Complexity O(n):

Linear time complexity, denoted as O(n), is a measure of the growth of the running time of an algorithm proportional to the size of the input.

```javascript
function find(arr, n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == n) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return null;
}

consle.log(find([23, 1, 55, 3, 6]));
```

- Quadratic Time Complexity O(n^2)

Quadratic time complexity, denoted as O(n^2), refers to an algorithm whose running time increases proportional to the square of the size of the input.

```javascript
function printAllPairs(arr) {
  // Outer loop runs n times
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // Inner loop also runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
      console.log(`Pair: (${arr[i]}, ${arr[j]})`);
    }
  }
}

const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
printAllPairs(myArray);
```

- Logarithmic Time Complexity O(Log n):

What is a Logarithm?
The power to which a base needs to be raised to reach a given number is called the logarithm of that number for the respective base.

```javascript
function isPowerOfFour(N) {
  // Check if N is greater than zero
  if (N <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Keep dividing N by 4 while it's divisible by 4
  while (N % 4 === 0) {
    N /= 4;
  }

  // If N has been reduced to 1, then it's a power of 4
  return N === 1 ? 1 : 0;
}
console.log(isPowerOfFour(16)); // Output: 1 (16 is 4^2)
console.log(isPowerOfFour(5)); // Output: 0 (5 is not a power of 4)
console.log(isPowerOfFour(64)); // Output: 1 (64 is 4^3)
```

```javascript
function sqrt(x) {
  if (x < 2) return x;

  let left = 1,
    right = x,
    result = 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (mid * mid <= x) {
      result = mid;
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

# Calculating Time Complexity in Big O Notation

Calculating the time complexity of an algorithm in Big O notation involves analyzing the code to understand how the running time increases as the input size (usually denoted as \( n \)) grows. Here’s a step-by-step guide to calculating the time complexity:

## 1. Identify the Basic Operations

- Identify the most basic operation(s) that are being repeated in your algorithm, such as comparisons, assignments, arithmetic operations, etc.
- These operations are typically found within loops or recursive calls, as they determine the overall time complexity.

## 2. Analyze Loops

- **Single Loop:** If an algorithm contains a single loop that runs \( n \) times, the time complexity is \( O(n) \).

  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Basic operation
  }
  ```

  **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)

- **Nested Loops:** If there are nested loops, multiply their complexities.

  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Outer loop: O(n)
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      // Inner loop: O(n)
      // Basic operation
    }
  }
  ```

  **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \times O(n) = O(n^2) \)

- **Multiple Loops:** If loops are sequential (one after the other), add their complexities.
  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // First loop: O(n)
    // Basic operation
  }
  for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    // Second loop: O(n)
    // Basic operation
  }
  ```
  **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) + O(n) = O(n) \)

## 3. Analyze Recursive Calls

- Analyze the number of times the recursive function calls itself and how the problem size reduces with each call.
- **Example (Binary Search):**
  ```javascript
  function binarySearch(arr, left, right, target) {
    if (left <= right) {
      let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
      if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
      if (arr[mid] > target) return binarySearch(arr, left, mid - 1, target);
      return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, right, target);
    }
    return -1;
  }
  ```
  **Time Complexity:** Since each call halves the input size, the time complexity is \( O(\log n) \).

## 4. Consider Any Conditional Statements

- If your algorithm contains conditional statements, determine which branch has the highest time complexity and use that for the overall complexity.
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
    // O(n) operation
  } else {
    // O(log n) operation
  }
  ```
  **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) (since it dominates \( O(\log n) \)).

## 5. Drop Constants and Lower Order Terms

- Big O notation focuses on the growth rate as \( n \) becomes large. Therefore, drop any constant factors and lower-order terms.
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  T(n) = 3n^2 + 5n + 10
  ```
  - Here, \( 3n^2 \) dominates as \( n \) grows, so the time complexity is \( O(n^2) \).

## 6. Consider Worst-Case Scenario

- Big O notation typically represents the worst-case scenario, so always consider the scenario where the algorithm takes the most time.

## 7. Use Common Big O Classifications

- Familiarize yourself with common Big O classifications, such as:
  - **\( O(1) \)**: Constant time (independent of input size)
  - **\( O(\log n) \)**: Logarithmic time
  - **\( O(n) \)**: Linear time
  - **\( O(n \log n) \)**: Linearithmic time
  - **\( O(n^2) \)**: Quadratic time
  - **\( O(2^n) \)**: Exponential time
  - **\( O(n!) \)**: Factorial time

## Example of Time Complexity Calculation

```javascript
function exampleFunction(arr) {
  let n = arr.length;

  // O(1) operation
  let sum = 0;

  // O(n) loop
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    sum += arr[i]; // Basic operation: O(1)
  }

  // Nested loop: O(n^2)
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      console.log(arr[i] + arr[j]); // Basic operation: O(1)
    }
  }

  return sum;
}
```
